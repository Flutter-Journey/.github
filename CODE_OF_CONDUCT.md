At **Flutter Journey**, we strive to foster a welcoming and inclusive community where everyone can grow as developers on their road to mastering Flutter. 🚀

## Our Commitment 💡

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of Flutter Journey, pledge to create a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of their age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We are committed to maintaining a respectful, supportive, and inclusive community where everyone feels valued.

## Standards of Behavior 🎯

To help maintain a positive environment, here are examples of expected behavior:

- **Be considerate and empathetic**: Treat others with kindness and understanding.
- **Respect differing opinions**: Discussions and disagreements are part of learning, but always remain courteous.
- **Constructive feedback**: Provide and accept feedback with a positive, learning-focused attitude.
- **Own your mistakes**: If you make a mistake, take responsibility and learn from it.
