# Flutter Journey Code of Conduct

At **Flutter Journey**, we are committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment where everyone can grow as developers on their journey with Flutter. We want all participants to feel valued and supported.

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of Flutter Journey, pledge to create a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of their age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, gender expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We are committed to maintaining a respectful and supportive community, where everyone can thrive.

## Our Standards

To help maintain a positive environment, here are examples of expected behavior:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
- Focus on the collective good of the community.
- Show empathy towards other community members.

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, unwelcome sexual attention, or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Harassment in any form (public or private).
- Publishing others' private information without consent.
- Other behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or learning setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. They have the authority to take appropriate action, including removing, editing, or rejecting content that violates the Code of Conduct, or banning participants for behaviors that are deemed inappropriate, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces (forums, chats, events) and extends to instances where a community member is representing Flutter Journey in public forums. Representation includes using official project e-mail addresses, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness any abusive or inappropriate behavior, please report it to **chunhthanhde.dev@gmail.com**. All complaints will be investigated promptly and confidentially.

## Enforcement

Leaders will take the following steps in response to violations:

1. **Correction**: A private written warning explaining the violation and its impact, with a request for an apology if appropriate.
2. **Warning**: For further incidents, a warning may be issued, restricting interaction with the community for a period of time.
3. **Temporary Ban**: For serious violations, a temporary ban may be enforced, limiting all forms of community interaction.
4. **Permanent Ban**: Repeated or severe violations may result in a permanent ban from the community.
